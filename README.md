Predicting winners of NFL games

Goal would be to build a model that can beat the experts, of the 4 papers/websites on this topic, 2 look to be successful.
thepredictiontracker.com ranks the systems using pct correct, against spread, absolute error, bias, and mean squared error.
This would take more work but would force me to better learn ML.
