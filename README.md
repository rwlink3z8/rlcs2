Analyzing different performance metrics for quarterback play in the NFL

Different quarterback performance metrics include passing rating, ESPN's total QBR, defense adjusted yards above replacement(DYAR), and defense adjusted value over average(DVOA).

Goal would be to scrape espn, pro-football-reference and football outsider for the different metrics, fit a regression model and see which, if any can predict future success, or rank all of the current metrics for quarterback play.
Stretch goal would be for me to develop a better quarterback rating metric.

Predicting winners of NFL games

Goal would be to build a model that can beat the experts, of the 4 papers/websites on this topic, 2 look to be successful.
thepredictiontracker.com ranks the systems using pct correct, against spread, absolute error, bias, and mean squared error.
This would take more work but would force me to better learn ML.

My brother runs a construction company in the Kansas City area, he does all of his bid sheets and calculations by hand. (Even after I showed him excel on the computer machine and built him a basic bid spreadsheet with big letters). The goal would be to use flask and build a website that can calculate a bid for a construction job and send 2 PDF's or CSVs to his email (internal and external versions) to help him keep better track of where the hell his money goes. This has been a personal project I have wanted to work on for a while. Something simple enough anyone could use it. I think it would have applications further than just his company as most construction industries largely focus more on the projects than they do technology.
